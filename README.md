# Thinki-Downloader
A php based utility to download courses from Thinkific based sites like PacktPub for personal offline use.  

If you want to support the project, consider [buying me some coffee](https://ko-fi.com/sumeet) for motivation!  

If you are a course maintainer and want to migrate from Thinkific, ping me at hello@sumeetnaik.com  

## How To Use:

### Prepare your environment

First clone the repo or download the zip file and unpack it.

1. Clone this repo or download the zip file.
2. If you have PHP >= 7.4.13 installed locally in your system, you can use this script directly. Skip to step 4(b).
3. Install Docker: [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/), and ffmpeg: [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/). (ffmpeg is optional, but recommended for merging audio and video files of presentations)

Now you're ready to set your `.env` file and use the solution (Docker or Direct).


### Get your course URL, cookie and URL

[![How to use Thinkifi-Downloader|width=100px](https://img.youtube.com/vi/owi-cOcpceI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owi-cOcpceI)  
[üì∫ Watch guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owi-cOcpceI)  

In the folder, you'll fine a .env file. If you're not seeing it, open it with a terminal, or enable "Show hidden files" on your operation system. If you're going to use the direct php method, you'll need to update the config.php instead.

- Open up your browser, and open the Dev Tool. If you're unsure on how to do that, search for "Dev Tool {BROWSER NAME}" on Google. Normally F12 will open it.
- Go to the "Network tab"
- Search after `course_player/v2/courses/`
- Click on the matched request (there should be one)
- I'd suggest to click on the "Raw"
- First adjust the COURSE_LINK in the .env file
- Now look after the "set-cookie" and copy the valye into "COOKIE_DATA"
- Lastly copy the "date" value into "CLIENT_DATE"

At this point, you should have changed the value of `COURSE_LINK`, `COOKIE_DATA` and `CLIENT_DATA`.

The blank version of the .env file looks like this:

```bash
COURSE_LINK=""

# If using selective download, add the following line and add the path of course data file downloaded from Thinki-Parser
COURSE_DATA_FILE=""

# Watch YouTube video to know how to get the client date and cookie data
CLIENT_DATE=""
COOKIE_DATA=""

# Set the video download quality. Default is 720p.
# Available Options: "Original File", "1080p", "720p", "540p", "360p", "224p"
VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_QUALITY="720p"
```

### Configure the downloader

If you want to merge audio and video files of presentations, install ffmpeg and set the following flag to true in config.php file, modify the following lines:
```php
$FFMPEG_PRESENTATION_MERGE_FLAG = true;
```

ffmpeg are already included in the Docker image.

### Preparing selective download

If you'd like to make a selective download, checkout [Thinki-Parser v0.0.1 Experimental Support](https://sumeetweb.github.io/Thinki-Parser/) and generate course data file.  

Then pass --json flag and file path of course data file. There's a example for each solution below.

Remember to update the `.env` and set the `COURSE_DATA_FILE` variable.

### Running the software

#### Using docker

> [!NOTE]
> On some systems, docker-compose should be called with `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`

Start the solution with:

```bash
docker-compose -f compose.yaml up
```

If you'd like to us the selective JSON file, remember to set the path of the JSON file in .env as `COURSE_DATA_FILE`.

Hereafter, simply fun:

```bash
docker-compose -f compose.selective.yaml up
```


#### Using the PHP script direcly on host machine

For Direct Method, remember to edit the config.php file and modify :

```php
$clientdate = "PASTE CLIENT DATE HERE";
$cookiedata = "PASTE COOKIE DATA HERE";
// Set the video download quality. Default is 720p.
// Available Options: "Original File", "1080p", "720p", "540p", "360p", "224p"
$video_download_quality = "720p";

// Set the following flag to true if you want to merge audio and video files of presentations
$FFMPEG_PRESENTATION_MERGE_FLAG = true;
```
 
Now simply run:

```bash
php thinkidownloader3.php LINK_HERE
```

If you're using the selective download method, provide the JSON path with:

```bash
php thinkidownloader3.php --json COURSE_DATA_FILE_PATH
```


> [!CAUTION]
